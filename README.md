# Horizon Theme for Nova
Based on the work of [Jonathan Olaleye's Horizon Theme](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), which is released under an MIT license.

## Instructions
You'll definitely need [Nova](https://nova.app/) installed on your Mac.
Once you do, you should be able to go to the **Extensions > Extensions Library** and click on the **Themes** tab.

If that does not work, clone/download the project. the **HorizonTheme.novaextension** should be recognized by Nova and let you install it that way.
