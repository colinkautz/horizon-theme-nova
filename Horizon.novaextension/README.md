# Horizon Theme
Based on the work of [Jonathan Olaleye's Horizon Theme](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), which is released under an MIT license.

## Instructions
As this is a theme for [Nova](https://nova.app), you'll need it installed on your Mac.

Once you do, you should be able to go to the `Extensions > Extension Library...`, and search for Horizon Theme.

If that does not work, clone/download the project. the `Horizon Theme.novaextension` file should be recognized by Nova and let you install it that way.
